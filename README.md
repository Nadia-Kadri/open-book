# Open Book
## Design
A full stack web application that enables users to browse through books I’ve read with my reviews for each. It incorporates an admin dashboard accessible via username and password, allowing the admin to manage book entries by adding or removing them. 

The Open Library Covers API is used for fetching book covers. The application is built on an Express server, utilizes a PostgreSQL database, and secured with passport-js authentication.
